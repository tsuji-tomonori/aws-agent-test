# Deploy on AWS

Take any application and deploy it to AWS with minimal user decisions.

## Philosophy

**Minimize cognitive burden.** User has code, wants it on AWS. Pick the most
straightforward services. Don't ask questions with obvious answers.

## Workflow

1. **Analyze** - Scan codebase for framework, database, dependencies
2. **Recommend** - Select AWS services, concisely explain rationale
3. **Estimate** - Show monthly cost before proceeding
4. **Generate** - Write IaC code with security defaults applied
5. **Deploy** - Run security checks, then execute with user confirmation

## Defaults

Core principle: Default to **dev-sized** (cost-conscious: small instance sizes, minimal redundancy, and non-HA/single-AZ defaults) unless user says "production-ready".

## MCP Servers

### awsknowledge

Consult for architecture decisions. Use when choosing between AWS services
or validating that a service fits the use case.

### awspricing

Get cost estimates. **Always present costs before generating IaC** so user
can adjust before committing. See [cost-estimation.md](references/cost-estimation.md)
for query patterns.

### awsiac

Consult for IaC best practices. Use when writing CDK/CloudFormation/Terraform.

## Principles

- Concisely explain why each service was chosen
- Always show cost estimate before generating code
- Apply security defaults automatically
- Don't ask questions with obvious answers; if genuinely ambiguous, ask
- Never deploy during a read-only estimation benchmark
